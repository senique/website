### NOTICE

As of March 14, 2017, the Kubernetes SIG-Docs-Maintainers group have begun migration of the User Guide content as announced previously to the [SIG Docs community](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-docs) through the [kubernetes-sig-docs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs) group and [kubernetes.slack.com #sig-docs](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs/) channel.

The user guides within this section are being refactored into topics within Tutorials, Tasks, and Concepts. Anything that has been moved will have a notice placed in its previous location as well as a link to its new location. The reorganization implements a new table of contents and should improve the documentation's findability and readability for a wider range of audiences.

For any questions, please contact: [kubernetes-sig-docs@googlegroups.com](mailto:kubernetes-sig-docs%40googlegroups.com)
